Off the top of my head, what are the key issues?
- Honesty/genuineness
  - Do people actually like bad media, and for what reasons?
  - Is it a problem if they don't? Maybe my instinct to dislike ironic appreciation is itself an assumption of my own
- Is it unfair or mean to the author of work?
  - Are artists owed anything for their art?
    - Surely people are owed basic respect, but does that extend to the work they produce?
  - Are there objective standards? If not, are there standards or conventions we fall back on when we say some media is bad?
- What is the difference between critique and bullying? Is there a difference? I think so.
- Whose voices are relevant? Are critics necessarily more "right" than casual movie-goers or reviewers who take a less formal or industry-backed stance?
- To what degree does the artist have a say about the quality or meaning of their work?
  - A good many artists will tell you (I think rightly) that you should create work for yourself.
  - This, I think, is a good philosophy to have. However when you make your work public - especially for sale - you open yourself up to critique.
  - Consider theories of communication, e.g. Encoding/Decoding model and its positions and how they relate to fan interpretation of bad media

- Collect opinions from friends, artists, and media curators who have their own histories with art and media

- What happens when an artist insists their art is good? Are they the ones who have the final say? What about when an artist becomes combative, e.g. David Sirlin
- Alternatively, some artists embrace it and either become one with the jank or use the critique to fuel improvement

- The perception of quality is in part dependent upon the medium being developed for
  - Audiences of films have fairly high standards, even for independent films. There are conventions and rules to film which even amateur filmmakers can follow or break deliberately.
  - Audiences of work on TikTok or Youtube have different standards from film and from each other, and they also have different conventions surrounding style and narrative voice, among other things.

# Outline
- I think a lot about media and communication
- I like bad movies, games, etc, and I like to watch and participate in good-natured ribbing about said bad media
- Describe history with kusogrande and awful games done quick
- Bring up argument which got me thinking about this initially
- Question: Is riffing on bad media - or even the celebration of bad media and calling it bad - good for art, is it rude, is it fair to artists?

- What do we mean by "good" art?

- Why do people like bad art? (Sub-question: Is it really bad if you like it?)

- Where do we draw the line on critique, and who gets to decide the value of art?

- Are there ways we can communicate about quality while also being respectful?

- What is the conclusion here?

# The question
A few years ago, a streamer I follow complained on his stream that many of the games he played were considered "kusoge" and that he thought it was rude to both him and game developers. He also remarked that the claim of "game preservation" was disingenuous, that it was a way for people to trash-talk game devs while appearing to lift up their work as important. While I don't agree with this - I think there's malicious intent being assigned - It did get me thinking about the ethics of it all. Is it in poor taste to remark on bad games - and art in general - in this way? After all, I'm not an artist, and if I wasn't there when some work was created, can I really critique it? Should I?

I personally think the answer is still yes, but I think it's worth considering this space. You may come to different conclusions than I, and that's fine.

- But, there is a question to be had about the ethics of this all. I mean, isn't it in bad spirit to put the work of others? Or even more, to produce a whole show about that?
- I realize that the very suggestion that "maybe Mystery Science Theater 3000 is in poor taste" will turn off some readers, but I think there's value in being able to reflect on ourselves and our social practices and question our assumptions about them. Is this thing I like potentially harmful? The answer can be no, of course.

And before we get started, I will first present my own perspective. I am not of the opinion that all art is good by virtue of being art, nor do I think that all creative output is necessarily art. But, I am also aware that these are very nebulous terms. _What do we mean when we say something is "good" or "bad"?_
- My intuition also says that there's not necessarily any harm in riffing on bad media - it is after all critique. When you publish your art into the world, you are opening it up to public criticism. This is a unifying experience of all artists who produce work. Criticism doesn't necessarily have to be fair even, as nice as it would be if it was.

- At the same time, I have met people who aren't fond of calling some media bad. A streamer I follow remarked once that they are typecast as someone who plays a lot of bad games but the games they play are all ones they genuinely like. They're simply unconventional. They feel as though the spirit of Awful GDQ is one of mockery or put-downs, where we are laughing at the developer instead of with them.

- I'm of two minds: On one hand, I want to respect and lift up artists. On the other hand, some media is, I think, just bad. But... what does it actually mean for art to be bad, and how can we tell?

For me, calling a piece of art "bad" is a summary of all these facets, an average of sorts. But it might also be something I say with a certain context in mind, or simply an opinion. In reflecting on it, I think I've realized the inconsistent way in which I use this language. But that's to be expected, that's how people talk!

- Question: Why do we like bad media?
- Further question: What makes media "bad" per se?
