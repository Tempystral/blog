- I like Star Trek
  - I like Next Generation
- Characters are good, distinct feeling
  - In particular, Brent Spiner nailed Data's character from day 1
  - Picard was very bristly for a few episodes, which I suspect they toned down because it made him seem unpersonable
  - I remembered Wesley being terrible but he's not as bad as I remember. He's annoying at times, but he's not uncompelling.
  - I still like Tasha Yar. She's one of the only characters with a backstory and hints of it are brought up, but never expanded upon. Shame too, because she has a strong personality and the writers have taken care to ensure that her toughness isn't some butch lesbian stereotype. She's not one-note, unlike Worf
  - The only characters that feel flat are Geordi and Worf, who thankfully come into their own later in the series.
  - I don't even dislike Troi. I think a lot of people choose to focus on her (to be fair) useless remarks on the bridge when she does in fact offer real emotional support to the bridge crew elsewhere.
  - I do like how casual the crew is with each other off the bridge. Seems like the writers wanted to make the crew feel familiar right away.

- Writing is fun
  - For the most part, the writing is actually pretty good. Plenty of good jokes and the mysteries are written well. It's still schlock, but it's schlock I enjoy.
  - Very much influenced by classic sci-fi and adventure of the week storytelling. Still heavily influenced by the original series.
  - Some episodes are great!
    - The pilot starts off weak but ends quite strong. Q's initial bit takes SO long and there's no tension because a) it's the pilot and b) nothing is actually explained. Q's accusations of humanity are vague and unspecific and all the actual argumentation is procedural fuckery.
  - Some episodes are BAD, like really bad
    - Justice and Angel One in particular are extremely uninteresting, and also the most TOS-feeling. Both episodes come down to a society so impossibly rigid it could never function butting heads with a Federation who see fit to lecture them on their moral superiority. It's boring writing and it makes the Federation feel extremely pretentious, the opposite of a society who respect the ways of other cultures. And of course they HAVE to because both episodes feature an insane conflict where a minor transgression leads to a legal death sentence.
    - Maybe the point was to illustrate that some views are truly incompatible, and despite ones' best efforts it's not possible to stand with all values. That would be a good and grounded story, but neither of those episodes has the nuance required to communicate that, only that "death sentence bad" and "inequality bad" which like... we know, good!
